	<h2>FAQ</h2>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>How to pick up a color of painting surface?</strong><br />There are
			two possible solutions:
			<ol>
				<li>Use the Pickup Tool to locate a color on surface and fill
					the color of the current painting tool.&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Use the Pickup Gesture to collect the color liquid</li>
			</ol>The first solution put more quantity of liquid on the Painting Tool.
			The second one may have blended colors and different color pattern on
			the Painting Tool. &nbsp;
		</li>
		<li>
		  <p><strong> How to produce the Impasto effect?</strong><br>
		    The most important is to
		    keep the density of color liquid. That mean you shouldn't dilute it
		    using Turpentine. And then you should try to produce the thick
		    layer. There are several ways: </p>
		  <table>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th>Tool</th>
						<th>Description</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Tube</td>
						<td>Produce the maximum thick layer</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Knife</td>
						<td>Fill Knife with a Color with maximum pressure to get more
							quantity, and then tag Knife on Painting Support. To repeat the
							same action, you can enable &quot;Save Color Patterns&quot; with
							&quot;Auto Reset&quot; option.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Brush</td>
						<td>Same as Knife</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
		</li>
		<li><strong>There are too much color on my canvas, how to remove it?</strong><br />With
			Knife, you rotate angle &gt; 45&deg; and use the backward painting
			direction to remove it.<br />With Brush, you can turn on the Auto
			Clean option and paint repeatedly.
		</li>
		<li><strong>How to prepare a gradient color ?</strong><br />You can use a knife
			in Blending mode (<span>rotation angle </span>&lt; 45&deg;) to blend
			two or more colors.
		</li>
		<li><strong>How to produce bristle marks ?</strong><br />
		<span>To produce bristle marks, the quantity of color liquid
				loaded in Brush is very important. You need first to prepare the
				color on Palette and use the Pickup Gesture to load the color in
				Painting Tool, and then paint on the surface with maximum pressure
				to produce thin layer of color.</span></li>
		<li><span><strong>How to prepare a background ?</strong></span><br />A background
			should be a very thin layer.&nbsp;The solution is to use the more wet
			color. To prepare the wet color, two tools can be used: <span>Wetness
				Plan and Turpentine. Once the wet color is prepared, you can use
				either Knife or brush to pant the thin layer. <span>And the
					option Auto Reset is very help for the repeated blending
					operations.</span>
